Overview
========

Pyrocko is a general purpose seismology toolbox and library. It is written in
the Python programming language with some extensions written in C. It can be
used as a :doc:`framework </library/index>` for own developments but also
includes standalone :doc:`applications </apps/index>` for everyday
seismological practice. The :doc:`examples </library/examples/index>` section
is a good starting point to get an overview on the functionality offered by
Pyrocko.
