It can be used as a framework for own developments but also contains a few
standalone tools for everyday seismological practice:

* Snuffler: an extensible seismogram browser and workbench
* Cake: travel-time and ray-path computations for 1D layered earthmodels
* Fomosto: a tool to manage pre-calculated Green's function stores
* Jackseis: a command-line tool for common waveform archive data manipulations
