* ``snuffler``: an extensible seismogram browser and workbench
* ``cake``: travel-time and ray-path computations for 1D layered earthmodels
* ``fomosto``: a tool to manage pre-calculated Green's function stores
* ``jackseis``: a command-line tool for common waveform archive data manipulations
* ``colosseo``: create synthetic earthquake scenarios, serving waveforms and static displacements
