Sparrow - *geospatial data visualization*
=========================================

The :program:`Sparrow` application provides a virtual globe to visualize
earthquake hypocenters, earthquake source models, fault traces, topography
datasets and other geoyhisical datasets in 3D and over time. Its primary focus
is on simplicity, allowing for interactive dataset exploration and export of
short animations for scientific presentations.
